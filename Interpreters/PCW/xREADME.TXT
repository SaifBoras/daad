PCW files:

PCWEDI.BIN -> English interpreter
PCWSDI.BIN -> Spanish interpreter
PARTE001.CHR -> charset
PARTE001.DAT -> empty graphics DB with standard charset

Bundling releases:

use DRC to compile PARTE001.DDB with PCW target
add game DB, graphics, interpreter and charset on disk

You can optionally place a loading screen as PARTE001.SCR on disk

Hint: the interpreters always ask which part you want to launch, regardless how many parts there are on disk. We might address that at a later date but currently there is no workaround for games with one part only.
